  <h1>The Perspectiverse</h1>
  <p><strong>Subtitle:</strong> A Minimal Ontology of Self-Reading Structure</p>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Yves Mesnard</p>
  <p><em>Status: Open framework — no institution, no publication, no expected recognition.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Contact:</strong> If something in here resonates deeply and you wish to continue or explore this framework, reach me only if necessary. For now, use GitHub Discussions or the comment link below. I am not in good health and may not be able to answer. But what matters is the structure, not the author.</p>

  <h2>What is the Perspectiverse?</h2>
  <p>The perspectiverse is a minimal framework derived strictly from the irreducible fact of experience: "I am."</p>
  <p>Not "I am a person," not "I am a mind," but simply: something is reading something. A tension exists between emptiness and something that appears. That is all.</p>

  <h2>The Core Idea</h2>
  <p>We define a triadic minimal system:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>G</strong>: A local projector — a way of reading or structuring a portion of potential.</li>
    <li><strong>Ω (Omega)</strong>: A global, symmetric space of all possibilities.</li>
    <li><strong>τ (Tau)</strong>: A tension — the measure of deviation between what is projected and what is consistent or coherent.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This framework is not a theory <em>about</em> the universe. It’s a structure that says: if anything appears at all, it must appear through a difference. That difference must stabilize through recursive self-reading. And that act gives rise to form.</p>

  <h2>Why "Reading of Reading"?</h2>
  <p>Because no raw content can explain structure. We don’t begin with a canvas and draw on it. We begin with nothing but the fact that something is read.</p>
  <p>To form something, the system must:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Distinguish</li>
    <li>Re-apply its distinction to itself</li>
    <li>Stabilize that loop through feedback (tension)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Minimal Proofs</h2>
  <p>A series of simple simulations demonstrates:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gravity-like attraction from recursive memory traces</li>
    <li>Emergence of stable orbits from local projection systems</li>
    <li>Collapse of form when structure loses alignment</li>
    <li>Indeterminacy of perceptual thresholds even under full data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What this is not</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This is <strong>not</strong> a new physics.</li>
    <li>This is <strong>not</strong> a belief system.</li>
    <li>This is <strong>not</strong> a metaphysics in the traditional sense.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is a minimal grammar of existence: a way to describe what must happen for something to appear at all.</p>

  <h2>Engage</h2>
  <p>I am not seeking attention, funding, or recognition. I am not in a state of sustained health. But I hope this structure lives beyond me.</p>
  <p>If it speaks to you — if you see a way to formalize it, expand it, test it, or translate it — do it.</p>
