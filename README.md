# The Perspectiverse

A minimal ontological framework derived from the irreducible fact of subjective presence: *I am* — but not *someone*, not *conscious*, simply that something appears, and the appearance is readable.

This repository hosts the static site presenting the Perspectiverse. The theory does not propose new physical laws, nor does it rely on existing ontologies of particles or agents. It begins from the pure logic of **self-reading tension**, and lets structure emerge.

## What's here

- **index.html** — The main site page
- **Link to Zenodo** — Full set of PDFs with simulated minimal proofs
- **Future video space** — Room for embedded explanatory content

## Key implications (to be developed further)

This structure, while minimal, implies:

- That stable forms can emerge from pure recursion without substrate.
- That different forms of agency and perception may exist, not centered on human-like identity.
- That time, eternity, and recurrence are structurally required in *any* readable world.
- That perception may exist without a perceiver, as a stabilized pattern of divergence.

Further work (by others or the community) could clarify these directions.

If something resonates here, you're welcome to engage — slowly, thoughtfully, structurally.
