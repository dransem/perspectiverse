# The Perspectiverse - Reflexive Tension Ontology (RTO)

Reflexive Tension Ontology (RTO) is A minimal ontological framework derived from the irreducible fact of subjective presence: *I am* — but not *someone*, not *conscious*, simply that something appears, and the appearance is readable.

This repository hosts the static site presenting RTO. The theory does not propose new physical laws, nor does it rely on existing ontologies of particles or agents. It begins from the pure logic of **self-reading tension**, and lets structure emerge.

## Key implications

This structure, while minimal, implies:

    Nothing appears unless G differentiates within Ω through τ.
    All perceived form is a stabilized reduction of τ.
    Space is the memory of differentiated recurrence; time is the order of re-readability.
    Consciousness is the reflexive re-reading of one’s own tension.
    If a structure stably reduces τ, it is — for all structural purposes — real.
